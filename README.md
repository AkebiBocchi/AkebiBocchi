## Hi there 👋

# Rabbit House里的孤独常客，但是近期找不到咖啡店的门在哪
## **Bully 我，你的所有设备将自动下载Genshin impact**
### 近期在做时间序列预测和arduino小玩意，我会将制作步骤发布于此（😅真的有人需要这种无聊且重复的教程吗？）
### 甚至还会发布各种现实生活指南（😅也许是菜谱？）
### translated English ver. :
# The Lonely Regular at Rabbit House, but Recently Can't Find the Coffee Shop's Door
## **Bully Me, All Your Devices Will Automatically Download Genshin Impact**
### Recently working on time series forecasting and Arduino gadgets, I will post the steps here (does anyone really need such boring and repetitive tutorials?)
### We will even publish various real-life guides (maybe recipes?)
